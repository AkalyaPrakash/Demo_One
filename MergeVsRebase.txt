Git merge
Merge lets you merge different Git branches.
Merge logs show you the complete history of commit merging.
All the commits on a feature branch are combined into a single commit on the master branch.
Merge is best used when the target branch is supposed to be shared.
Merge preserves history.

Git Rebase
Rebase allows you to integrate the changes from one branch into another.
Rebase logs are linear. As the commits are rebased, the history is altered to reflect this.
All commits are rebased, and the same number of commits are added to the master branch.
Rebase is best used when the target branch is private.
Rebase rewrites history.
